Other features:
- Render: calls the Azure Devops API to generate the full YAML, rendering all chidren templates. Useful for debugging the final YAML, as generated by ADO

- List Dependencies: inspect the YAML and lists all referenced templates, including the ones defined in remote repositories (note: requires configuring a mapping). Useful when troubleshooting the [100 templates limit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/templates?view=azure-devops&pivots=templates-includes#imposed-limits-on-template-updates).
